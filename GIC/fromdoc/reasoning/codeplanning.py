I want to build a Python app that takes user questions and looks them up in a 
database where they are mapped to answers. If there is close match, it retrieves 
the matched answer. If there isn't, it asks the user to provide an answer and 
stores the question/answer pair in the database. Make a plan for the directory 
structure you'll need, then return each file in full. Only supply your reasoning 
at the beginning and end, not throughout the code.
